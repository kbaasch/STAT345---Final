We will communicate via our group chat on messages.
We'll communicate at least once a week, and more as we begin to work more on the project, to tell everyone what we've worked on and establish expectations for what we will do over the next week.

Parts we are intending to work on:
- Find and summarize monopoly rules (Part 1)
-	Simulate a dice roll
- Determine which properties are landed on most
- Create a visualization for frequency of landing on each property
